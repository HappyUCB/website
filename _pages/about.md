I am currently a postdoc researcher at [Caltech](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/), working with Prof. [Adam Wierman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/) and Prof. [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/). Earlier, I obtained my Ph.D. from [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) department at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by [Prof. Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). 

I will be joining the [ECE department](http://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD as an Assistant Professor starting July 2021. My research interests are in the area of energy systems and cyberphysical systems, spanning from machine learning, optimization to control. If you're interested in any of the above and would like to chat, feel free to send me an email at [yshi7@caltech.edu](yshi7@caltech.edu).
