I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). My research interests are in area of **cyber-physical** and **energy systems**, from the perspective of machine learning, optimization, and control.
During my Ph.D. studies, I developed algorithms for controlling and optimizing resources in energy systems and discovered fundamental insights in data-driven control systems. My work has been applied by Microsoft, Doosan Gridtech, Centrica, JD.com and DeepMind.
