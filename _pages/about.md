I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Prof. Baosen Zhang](https://zhangbaosen.github.io/). At the same time, I'm pursuing a master degree in the Department of Statistics. My research interests focus on the area of energy systems from the perspective of machine learning, optimization, and control.
