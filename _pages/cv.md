Work experience
======
* Summer 2019: Research Scientist Intern
  * DeepMind, London
  * Summary: We proposed a novel data-driven framework for incorporating robustness into continuous control RL algorithms under model uncertainties. The proposed algorithm showed improved robust performance in various robotic control tasks, including MuJoCo and shadow dexterous hand.
  * Supervisors: Dr. [Daniel J. Mankowitz](https://danielmankowitz.wixsite.com/danielm), Dr. [Timothy Mann](https://kingtim1.github.io/), Dr. [Todd Hester](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~todd/)
  
* Summer 2018: Research Scientist Intern
  * JD.com Silicon Valley Research Center
  * Summary: We studied the optimal inventory control problem under environmental uncertainties. A new one-step end-to-end (E2E) framework is proposed that outputs order decisions directly from features via a modular neural network. It achieved over 10\% cost saving in JD.com production testing.
  * Supervisor: Prof. [Zuojun (Max) Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/), Dr. [Rong Yuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rong-yuan-b4b15026), Dr. [Di Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thuwoody)  
  
* Summer 2017: Power System Research Intern
  * Doosan GridTech
  * Summary: During this internship, I built optimization models and carried out sensitivity analysis for multiple distributed energy resource projects (e.g. energy storage, large-scale 	solar and wind farms).   
  * Supervisor: Dr. [Tess Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tesslawannawilliams)
