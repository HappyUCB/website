We study the interaction of strategic players in continuous action Cournot games with bandit feedback. Our current results show that: 1) if players all adopt two classes of learning algorithms (i.e., no-regret algorithms and policy gradient), their joint action would converge to the unique Nash equilibrium; 2) exploiting the structure of the game can lead to much faster convergence rates.
